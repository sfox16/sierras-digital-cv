<p> My name is Sierra Fox. I was born in Edgewater, Maryland on the East Coast of the United States of America.<br>
        I am a freshman at <a href="https://www.elon.edu" target="_blank">Elon University</a>, 
        and I am a student in the <a href="https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/communications/" target="_blank">School of Communications</a>!

<h2 style="color: rgb(154, 144, 219);text-decoration: underline;">Professional Life</h2><hr>
<p>
As a student, I have been involved in several leadership positions and creative roles. <br>
I held a management position as well as overseeing the visual media for my highschool's Harvest for the Hungry campaign which raised monetary and canned donations for neighboring counties in need.
Academically, I have maintained honor-roll for my entire highschool career. <br>
I am also an AP Scholar.

<h2 style="color: rgb(154, 144, 219);text-decoration: underline;">Personal Life </h2><hr>
<p> Many of my hobbies are centered around creativity and art.<br>
     I love music, painting, digital art and film.<br>
      I listen to music often and it allows me to explore other media through the creativity I harness from music I enjoy.<br>
       Music has become a passion of mine aswell as a source of inspiration for many aspects of my life.<br>

     <p> I have been a long-time lover of nail art and acrylic nails. In 2019, I became obsessed with doing my own nail sets and I quickly progressed with this hobby.
         <br>I have some examples of my work <a href="images.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
         <br>
        I love fashion and keeping up with the constant changing fashion industry and it's trends.<br>
        Experimenting with fashion is intertwined
        with my creative life. For me, fashion is another medium for my art.
